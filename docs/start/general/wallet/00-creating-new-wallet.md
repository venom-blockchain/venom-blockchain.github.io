### Generating the seed phrase


To start experiencing the Venom Blockchain the user would first need to create a new Venom wallet account.
There are different types of accounts on the Venom Wallet platform - a personal account (default) or multisig for a corporate use.

We strongly recommend to keep it in the “safe environment”, never hand it over to someone and do not share it with third parties. Once created, the seed phrase gives access to the funds and information related to your wallet account. Make sure to save your seed phrase, just click the “copy” button to transfer the words to your device. We, as well, recommend to backup the seed phrase written down on a sheet of paper and store it in a dark cool place. When done, select an “I wrote it down on paper”.
