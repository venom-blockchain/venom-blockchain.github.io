## Performing a transaction

The simplest way to transfer crypto to another account via the Venom Wallet extension is to use the quick command right from the home screen of the wallet account.

 2. Select a command to “Send”. The dialogue window will appear.  
 3. At the top of the “Send your    funds”    screen select the token which you are going to send.
