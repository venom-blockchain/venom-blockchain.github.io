## Performing a transaction

The simplest way to transfer crypto to another account via the Venom Wallet extension is to use the quick command from the home screen of the wallet account.

 2. Select the "Send" command from the main screen of the Venom Wallet extension. The dialogue window will appear.  
 3. At the top of the “Send your funds” screen select the token which you are going to send.

Once all the required information has been entered on the dialogue window, the Venom Wallet extension will calculate the gas fee, which is a small fee that is required to be paid to the network to process the transaction. The calculated gas fee will be displayed in the "Blockchain fee" field. It's important to note that the gas fee is dynamic and can change over time.

6. Enter the Wallet password and click “Confirm transaction”. 

The completed transaction will be now displayed on the home screen of the wallet extension under the “Transactions” tab.
