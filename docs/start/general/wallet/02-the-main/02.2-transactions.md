### Revising history and details
  

For the user convenience a vital transactional data is always available on hand in the Venom Wallet.

**Here a few steps for checking your transaction history via wallet extension:**

  

1. Launch an application and log in to your account.
2. Open the homepage of the wallet window.

The list of the current wallet’s operational activity (such as date and time, amount, hash ID, transaction’s addresses and gas fee paid) would be available to the user. You may fast-check the data of every wallet added to your Venom blockchain account, by changing the wallet’s priority on the UI.
