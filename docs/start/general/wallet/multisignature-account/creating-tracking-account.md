# Creating Tracking Account
:::info
To add a tracking account, ensure that the public key of the default account has been set as a custodian for the multisignature account for which a new tracking account is being created.

**Here are a few steps to follow when creating a new tracking account:**
1. On the main screen, navigate to the section where your existing accounts are located and scroll until you reach the option labeled "Add Account".
2. When you select the "Add Account" option, a new window will appear with two options: "Add Account" and "Add a tracking account". Select "Add a tracking account" and then click on the "Next" button.

3. In the following window, provide a name for the new tracking account and paste the address of the multisignature account.
