# Getting Started

The Knowledge Base is the entry point into the Venom universe. Get to know the technology behind the incredible scalability of the Venom blockchain.

:::info
At present, the Venom blockchain is running in testnet and is not intended to process or store transactions related to real value.

Please note that there is currently no official information regarding the launch of token sales. Any messages about token sales that you may receive from other sources are not authorized and are not associated with the Venom Foundation.

We recommend all users carefully verify the information and follow official developer channels to obtain up-to-date information.

It contains a [Comparison of Ethereum vs Venom](../../build/development-guides/comparing-of-ethereum-vs-venom-architectures.md) to help you understand the key differences between EVM and TVM used in the Venom blockchain and to facilitate a smooth migration to TVM development.

If you are interested in maintaining the network, the maintenance section provides all the necessary information on the roles of [Network Maintainers](../maintain/network-maintainers.md), and [How to run a Venom Validator Node](../maintain/how-to-become-a-validator.md).
