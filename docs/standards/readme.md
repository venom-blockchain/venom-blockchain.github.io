The Venom blockchain has an essential set of standards from launch, and we also call on the community to contribute to maintaining the Venom standards.

## [Fungible token](/standards/TIP-3/core-description)

Just as ERC-20 is the most popular standard in the Ethereum network, TIP-3 assumes the same role in the Venom network. TIP-3 was designed to match the distributed system design of the Venom network and is cost-effective for its fee-paying model.

TIP-3 provides the following functionalities

- transfer tokens from one account to another  
- get the current token balance of an account  
- get the total supply of the token available on the network  
- mint and burn tokens  

## [Non-Fungible Token](/standards/TIP-4/core-description)

The standard describes the second most popular type of token as NFT. Designed specifically for the architecture of the Venom network is built, the TIP-4 standard provides an optimal way to create, exchange, and trade non-fungible tokens.

## [Standard Interface Detection](/standards/TIP-6/core-description)

Smart contracts in the Venom network can implement a wide variety of functionality - wallets, tokens, exchanges and so on. We need a standard way to determine the type of smart contract without relying on knowledge of its internal structure.
